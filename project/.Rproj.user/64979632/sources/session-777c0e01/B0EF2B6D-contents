# Converting to CSV
First step in our project is to convert the .xslx file into a .csv file
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
library(readxl)

data <- read_excel("data/Voluntary-Registry-Offsets-Database--v2024-08-31.xlsx",sheet = "PROJECTS")

output_path <- file.path("data","project_data.csv")
write.csv(data, output_path, row.names = FALSE)
```

# Data Wrangling

Since 3 regressions are to be performed on this dataset, the dataset has to be grouped by and aggregated 3 times. 

## Setting up a Base Dataframe

Before doing any of the three specific data wrangles for the regressions,We will set up a base dataframe(project_df) for an easy reference.


```{r}
#| warning: false

#load in libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}

project_data <- read.csv("data/project_data.csv")

```


```{r}
#Setting up base dataframe for all 3 group by and aggregations
project_df <- project_data |>
  select(
    project_name = ...2,
    scope = ...6,
    type = ...7,
    credits_issued = ...16
  ) |>
  slice(-(1:3))|>
  drop_na()

glimpse(project_df)

```


```{r}
#Checking how many projects failed to reduce or remove even 1 metric ton of CO2
zero_count <- project_df |>
  filter(credits_issued == 0) |>
  nrow()

zero_count
```
## First Wrangle

The first wrangle is to include the project name, the scope of the project(a multinomial variable), and the credits issued,this is a numerical value that indicates the amount of carbon credits created. A carbon credit represents a 1 metric ton reduction or removal of CO2 from the atmosphere that can be sold to companies to offset their emission.

```{r}
#Creating dataframe for comparing renewable energy vs supply chains vs forestry

general_df <- project_df |>
  select(-type)|>
  mutate(
    scope = case_match(scope,
                       "Renewable Energy" ~ "Renewables",
                       "Forestry & Land Use" ~ "Reforestation",
                       .default = "Supply Chain"
                                              ),
    credits_issued = ifelse(credits_issued == 0, NA, credits_issued))

glimpse(general_df)
```


```{r}
general_df |>
  count(scope)
```
There are 1827 observations on Reforestation projects, 2367 on Renewables, and 5352 for all the various supply chains.


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
wrangle1_path <- file.path("data","general_comparison.csv")
write.csv(general_df,wrangle1_path, row.names = FALSE)
```

## Second Wrangle
The second regression we are preforming is comparing the different types of renewable energy with each other, this includes: Biomass, Geothermal, Hydropower, Bundled Renewables, Wind, and Solar. This dataset will include project name, the type (filtered for only renewable energy types), and carbon credits issued.

```{r}
renewables_df <- project_df |>
  filter(scope == "Renewable Energy") |>
  select(-scope)|>
  mutate(
    type = case_match(type,
                      "Biomass" ~ "Biomass",
                      "Geothermal" ~ "Geothermal",
                      "Hydropower" ~ "Hydropower",
                      "RE Bundled (Bundled Renewables)" ~ "Bundled Renewables",
                      "Wind" ~ "Wind",
                      .default = "Solar"),
    credits_issued = ifelse(credits_issued == 0, NA, credits_issued))

glimpse(renewables_df)
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
wrangle2_path <- file.path("data","renewable_comparison.csv")
write.csv(renewables_df,wrangle2_path,row.names=FALSE)
```

## Third Wrangle
This dataset is similar to the second however we are comparing the different supply chains, this includes: Agriculture, Carbon Capture, Chemical Processes, Community, Industrial/Commercial, Transportation, Waste Management.

```{r}
supplychain_df <- project_df |>
  filter(!(scope %in% c("Renewable Energy", "Forestry & Land Use"))) |>
  select(-type) |>
  mutate(
    scope = case_match(scope,
                       "Agriculture" ~ "Agriculture",
                       "Carbon Capture & Storage" ~ "Carbon Capture",
                       "Chemical Processes" ~ "Chemical Processes",
                       "Household & Community" ~ "Community",
                       "Industrial & Commercial" ~ "Industrial/Commercial",
                       "Transportation" ~ "Transportation",
                       "Waste Management" ~ "Waste Management"),
    credits_issued = ifelse(credits_issued == 0, NA, credits_issued))

glimpse(supplychain_df)
              
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
wrangle3_path <- file.path("data","supply_chain_comparison.csv")
write.csv(supplychain_df,wrangle3_path,row.names=FALSE)
```
